    #Challenge: Responsive Landing Page
    You will convert a Figma design into a fully responsive landing page using HTML5 and SCSS. The design includes common landing page sections such as header, hero, features, testimonials, and footer.
 
    ##Technologies Used
    - Use semantic HTML5 for structure
    - Use SCSS for styling (organized with variables, nesting, partials if needed)
    - Follow the BEM naming convention strictly for all CSS class names
    - Layout must be fully responsive
    - Use Flexbox and/or CSS Grid for layout
    - Do not use any CSS framework (no Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.)
 
###Goal of the Challenge:
- Convert UI design into code using best HTML/CSS practices
- Practice structuring scalable styles using BEM + SCSS
- Build responsive layouts with Flexbox/Grid
- Improve attention to detail by matching pixel-perfect design
- Reinforce CSS organization and component thinking
